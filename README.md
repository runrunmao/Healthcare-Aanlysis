## Overview
This project showcases my expertise in SQL for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using a healthcare dataset. The goal was to extract actionable insights to improve patient outcomes, optimize hospital operations, and support decision-making. This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data challenges, derive meaningful insights, and present them in a clear and professional manner.



## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL Proficiency**: Complex queries, joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions
- **Data Cleaning** : Handling duplicates, missing values, anomalies, and standardizing data.
- **Data Analysis** : Identifying trends, patterns, and key metrics in healthcare data.
- **Problem-Solving** : Addressing real-world healthcare challenges using data-driven approaches.
- **Documentation** : Clearly explaining the process, findings, and recommendations.



## Project Details

### Dataset
The dataset contains healthcare-related information, including
- Patient demographics (name, age, gender, blood type).
- Medical conditions and treatments.
- Hospital and doctor details.
- Insurance providers and billing amounts.
- Admission and discharge dates.
- Test results and medications.

### Tools Used
- **SQL**: For querying, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset
- **Database Management System** : PostgreSQL



## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Standardized Names**: Removed special characters and formatted names consistently.
- **Standardized Gender Values** : Converted gender values into consistent categories (Male, Female, Other).
- **Removed Duplicates** : Identified and removed exact duplicate records.
- **Handled Anomalies** : Detected and resolved inconsistencies (e.g., patients with multiple ages).
- **Created Patient IDs** : Assigned unique patient IDs to track individuals across visits.
- **Rounded Billing Amounts** : Standardized billing amounts to two decimal places.
- **Assigned Visit IDs** : Created unique visit IDs for each patient admission.

### 2. Data Analysis
Performed a comprehensive analysis to answer key business questions, including:

- **Hospital Performance** : Identified hospitals with the most visits and highest billing amounts.
- **Patient Insights** : Analyzed patient demographics, visit frequency, and billing trends.
- **Medical Conditions** : Explored the most common conditions and their treatments.
- **Doctor Performance** : Identified doctors with the most patient visits and diverse treatment expertise.
- **Admission Trends** : Analyzed admission types (urgent, emergency, elective) and their distribution.
- **Billing Analysis** : Calculated average billing amounts, highest/lowest bills, and correlations with patient age.
- **Readmission Rates** : Detected patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge.



## Key Findings
1. **Hospital Performance**:
   -  had the highest number of visits...

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict patient readmissions.
- Expand the dataset to include more variables for deeper analysis.
- Create an interactive dashboard for real-time data exploration.
